## Frontend Mentor - Mortgage repayment calculator
This is my solution of a challenge: Frontend Mentor - <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/mortgage-repayment-calculator-Galx1LXK73"> Mortgage Repayment Calculator </a>. It's a LEVEL 2 - JUNIOR challenge.

To finish this challenge, I needed to have  HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.

## The users are able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

I'm always happy to receive feedback on my work, so feel free to provide me with any.
